# Comparison of Machine Learning Classification Models
Applied LogisticRegression, SVM, RandomForest classification algorithms. Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for all models. And then assessed model performance (confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC AUC) and interpret performance from business impact viewpoint (false negatives vs false positives).
